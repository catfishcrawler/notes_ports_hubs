# notes_ports_hubs
recently installed a front facing usb 2.0 hub. I was forced to split the 9 pin jack because there was another device already using it. Well I'm noticing that while it does work for power and data, it's really slow. The fastest I can transfer data is 900kb/s or so, and right now it's crawling at about 300. Also, now the original two usb ports on the front of hte bix don't work, and if you plug anything into them, it cuts off all usb hubs except for the ones on the board. I haven't ever run into anything like that before. Anyways I was wondering if that is as much speed as I can expect from usb 2.0 or not, and if myabe my usb drives are just plugged into the wrong ports.   Here is the output of lsusb:   wolf@shaitan:~$ lsusb Bus 002 Device 002: ID 1871:01f0 Aveo Technology Corp.

USB Hub Bus 006 Device 001: ID 1d6b:0001 Linux Foundation 1.1 root hub  It's being initialized as USB 1.1 (possibly because of other devices connected to it).   I was forced to split the 9 pin jack because there was another device already using it. .. Also, now the original two usb ports on the front of hte bix don't work, and if you plug anything into them, it cuts off all usb hubs except for the ones on the board.  I would worry that too much power is being demanded. Evil Wayz August 22nd, 2016, 12:37 AM Well, I have a hub that plugs into a pci slot that runs off the bus, and it appears to be running at the proper speed. A little disappointed that my spiffy new front storage bay hub is only going to be useful for charging, but thems the breaks... Evil Wayz August 22nd, 2016, 12:47 AM The hub consists of power outlet usb slot, two usb 3.0 slots which are not in use, and four usb 2.0 slots. THose are connected to the split. I wonder if there is some sort of molex to 9 pin adapter I can use. That would feed enough power it seems to me. Evil Wayz August 28th, 2016, 12:52 AM OK, now my usb ports are just randomly assigning themselves. This is my lsusb output after a reboot. nothing was unplugged, internally or externally.:   wolf@shaitan:~$ lsusb Bus 006 Device 004: ID 1871:01f0 Aveo Technology Corp.
